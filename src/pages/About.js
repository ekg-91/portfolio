                too. Hey, look at me when I&apos;m talking to you, motherfucker.

                little Asian child with a blank expression on his face sitting
                outside on a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put
                quarters in it? No? Well, that&apos;s what you see at a toy

                Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That
                show&apos;s called a pilot. Then they show that show to the
                people who make shows, and on the strength of that one show they
                decide if they&apos;re going to make more shows. Some pilots get
                picked and become television programs. Some don&apos;t, become
                nothing. She starred in one of the ones that became nothing.
